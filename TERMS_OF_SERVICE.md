# Big Man Terms of Service

This is what you agree to when you use the Big Man discord bot.

## 1 : Using the application

Using this application, you agree not to *literally* copy, modify or any of the above without permission. Supporting the Github Repo is fine but please do not make another
bot out of this one.

## 2 : Using it properly

Using this application, you agree not to use it inappropriately. Just please don't.

## 3 : Using common sense

Using this application, you agree to use common sense. Be smart about how you use it and be good instead of not good. I shouldn't have to list 1000 rules for you to go over.
